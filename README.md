## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is my first frontendmentor challenge and I found really helpful to have a well organized template in order to keep the straight line following a consistent work method.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my knowledge about browser compatibility. Furthermore, setting dimentions and measures for me is often a matter of trial and error. I wonder if there's a way to be more precise or if it only will get simpler with practice. I'm also going to deepen into media queries, 'cause I know very little about them.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I consulted this site to clarify some gaps in my knowledge of html and css.

- [Rapid Tables](https://www.rapidtables.com/) - In order to soften shadows I converted hls values in rgba values. I found that this resource is good to do that.
